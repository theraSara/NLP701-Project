PHASE 1: Setup and Baseline
1. Set the environment --> DONE

2. Data loading and exploration --> DONE
    - load SST-2 and IMDB using HuggingFace (HF) ``datasets``
    - create stratified samples (200 examples)
    - document dataset statistics

3. Model fine-tuning --> DONE
    - starting with DistilBERT on SST-2
    - use HF trainer API
    - track metrics: accuracy, F1, training time
    - save checkpoints

PHASE 2: Interpretability Methods
1. Attention Visualization --> DONE
    - extract attention weights from the models 
    - visualize using BertViz 
    - save attention matrices for evaluation

2. Integrated Gradients --> DONE
    - use Captum's ``LayerIntegratedGradients``
    - generate attrubutions for sampled examples

3. SHAP --> DONE
    - use ``shap.Explainer`` with transformer models

4. LIME --> DONE
    - create text explainer 
    - generate local explanations

PHASE 3: Evaluation 
1. Faithfulness
2. Stability
3. Efficiency

Work division:
Divide the work by dataset.
1. SST-2 dataset has 100 total samples
3 models
4 methods
So the total number of samples would be: 100*3*4=1200 explanations

2. IMDB dataset has 100 total samples
3 models
4 methods
So the total number of samples would be: 100*3*4=1200 explanations

This way each one of us will focus on one dataset and we can work in parallel instead of waiting for each others results.
