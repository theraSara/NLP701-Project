1. Faithfulness Logic: (method-agnostic)
- Comprehensiveness = p(x) - p(x x_{top q%})
    * larger drop is better
- Sufficiency = p(x) - p(x_{top q%})
    * smaller drop is better

* Apply equally to Attention/IG/LIME/SHAP, as long as they all have the 
(tokens, importances).

2. Stability Logic: (method-agnostic)
- Spearman correlation between the original attribution vector and the
vector from the shuffled text at each ratio (shuf_010, shuf_050, etc.)
    * measures how sensitive a method's explanations are to word order/random
    shuffles.
    * lower correlation at higher shuffle = more sensitive to strucutre (expected)
* Apply equally to Attention/IG/LIME/SHAP, as long as they all have the 
(tokens, importances).



NOTE: 
- Faithfulness doesn’t need the permuted columns, only texts (original).
- Stability does need the permuted columns, so both permuted and text columns.
